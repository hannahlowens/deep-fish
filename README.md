Scripts for "Exploring trends in deep sea fish community structure reveals a mosaic of biodiversity across depth".

## Raw Data Cleaning
This page shows how the raw data downloaded from iDigBio (link) were processed prior to analysis.

## Global Analysis
We started with a global analysis of the dataset to identify areas that were well-sampled for further examination.

## Gulf of Mexico Analysis
The Gulf of Mexico was particularly densely sampled in the iDigBio dataset. We focused on this area to investigate finer-scale depth-structured patterns of fish diversity.
