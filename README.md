* `Occurrence_Search.R` reads a `.txt` list of taxa, searches the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database for occurrences for every species in the list, and generates citations for the occurrence data in accordance with GBIF's recommendations for best citation practices.

* `VisualizingOccurrencesForCheck.R` automatically reads all occurrence `.csv` files in a specified folder, rounds occurrence coordinates to four decimal points, removes duplicate results, and creates a `.pdf` atlas of clearn occurrences for each species.

* `Data_extraction_clean.R` reads in all occurrence `.csv` files and an environmental data file, extracts environmental data at all points, and writes the results to a new `.csv` file.
